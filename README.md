This file describes the Assumptions used to generate the "Averages_data.txt" and the various files in the repository

## Assumptions

The following uncompressed files are available in the working directory (datasciencecoursera) in the follwing order before the run_analysis.R code can be executed:

1.~\datasciencecoursera\test\subject_test

2.~\datasciencecoursera\test\X_test

3.~\datasciencecoursera\test\y_test

4.~\datasciencecoursera\train\subject_train

5.~\datasciencecoursera\train\X_train

6.~\datasciencecoursera\train\y_train

7.~\datasciencecoursera\features

8.~\datasciencecoursera\activity_labels
